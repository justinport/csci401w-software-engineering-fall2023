## Sprint Grading Overview

During our semester-long journey through the Agile Bootcamp, it's essential that we continuously reflect and improve. Your team's sprint performance plays a crucial role in your learning and growth. As we evaluate each sprint, I'll provide both an overall feedback and a detailed breakdown based on specific criteria.

## Sprint Grading Rubric: The Breakdown

| **Category**                 | **Objective**                                                                                      | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | **Feedback** | **Score** |

| **Planning**             | Assess the team's capability to strategize and chart a clear course for the sprint using tools like Trello. | Planning is the foundation of every sprint. Using Trello, teams should create Product Backlog Items (PBIs) and tasks, providing a clear roadmap. Weekly planning meetings are essential, with meticulously recorded notes capturing key decisions and discussions.                                                                                             |              |           |
| **Teamwork & Collaboration** | Gauge the synergy, communication, and collective problem-solving within the team.                | In software engineering, success is collective. This category assesses how well team members communicate, support each other, and work together. Effective teams foster mutual respect, ensure all voices are heard, and collaboratively find solutions to problems.                                                                                        |              |           |
| **Deliverables**         | Evaluate the tangible outcomes, their quality, completeness, and timeliness.                    | The aim of every sprint is to produce tangible deliverables, from code segments and design elements to documentation. Deliverables should not only be completed but also adhere to the quality standards agreed upon, meeting the criteria set out in the PBIs and tasks.                                                                                          |              |           |
| **Execution**            | Examine the team's ability to actualize their plans, surmount challenges, and adapt when needed. | Execution transforms planning into reality. This category evaluates how the team sticks to their plans, navigates complexities, remains resilient, and ensures that the sprint's objectives are achieved.                                                                                                                                                  |              |           |
