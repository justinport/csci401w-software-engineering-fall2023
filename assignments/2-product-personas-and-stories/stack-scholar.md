Scenario: An intermediate developer navigates to the StackScholar Repository, selects an API and Database connection example, and follows through, enhancing their backend proficiency.

## User Stories

### Feature1: API & Database Connection

**Description**

As an educator, I want to create an example that demonstrates how to set up an API and establish a database connection, allowing students to grasp backend essentials.

**User Story 1**

As an instructor, I want to provide a detailed README with the API and Database example, ensuring students can follow the setup and implementation steps.

**User Story 2**

As a student, I want to clone the API and Database example to my local machine, allowing me to practice, modify, and understand its workings.

### Feature2: UI for Data Retrieval

**Description**

As an educator, I want to create a UI example that retrieves and displays data from an API, offering students insights into frontend-backend integrations.

**User Story 1**

As a student, I want to explore the UI example's code to understand how API requests are made and data is rendered on the frontend.

### Feature3: Python Script for Database Setup

**Description**

As an educator, I want to create a Python script that facilitates easy database setup, streamlining the initial steps for students.

**User Story 1**

As a student, I want to run the provided Python script, automating the process of database initialization and setup for my local development.

**User Story 2**

As an instructor, I want the Python script to have clear comments and documentation, ensuring that students can understand the logic behind each operation.
