## Objective
To provide a hands-on understanding of Agile methodologies and User Story management. By the end of this assignment, you should be able to:
- Select relevant user stories for your project.
- Organize and prioritize these stories using Trello.
- Assign user stories to appropriate team members.
- Work collaboratively to complete these user stories.
- Demonstrate the implemented features based on the completed user stories.

## Instructions

### User Story Creation
- As a group, brainstorm potential features and requirements for your software project.
- Convert these features into user stories. Remember, a good user story typically follows the format: 
  > "As a [type of user], I want [an action] so that [a benefit/a value]".
- Note: MOST of this should be done already from "Product personas and stories" assignment.

### Setting Up Trello
- Create a new board for your project on [Trello](https://trello.com/).
- Create the necessary lists to manage your user stories. A basic setup might include lists like `Backlog`, `To Do`, `In Progress`, `Review`, and `Done`.
- Add your user stories to the `Backlog` or `To Do` list on Trello as individual cards.
- Note: This SHOULD be done already.

### Prioritizing and Assigning User Stories
- Prioritize the user stories based on their importance, dependencies, and the overall project scope.
- Discuss and decide as a team how to distribute the work. Assign each Trello card (user story) to one or more team members. Remember to consider each member's strengths, skills, and workload.
- Make sure there is CLEAR acceptance criteria.

### Working on the User Stories
- As you begin working on a user story, move its corresponding Trello card to the `In Progress` list.
- Communicate with your team members regularly. If you face any blockers or need clarifications, address them promptly.
- After review, move the card to the `Done` list.

### Demonstration
- Once all the assigned user stories for this sprint/assignment are in the `Done` list, prepare a demonstration.
- Your demo should showcase the implemented features and how they relate to the respective user stories.
- All team members should participate in the demonstration, explaining their contributions and the importance of their completed user stories to the overall project.

## Submission
- Provide a link to your Trello board so that progress can be monitored.
- Create a short recording demonstrating your work (5-10 mins). Post the video to your teams channel

## Evaluation
Your group will be evaluated on:
- The quality and relevance of your user stories.
- Effective use of Trello to manage and track progress.
- Collaboration and communication among team members.
- The completion of the user stories assigned for this session.
- The quality and clarity of your demonstration.

## Tips and Considerations

1. **Reach Out to the Team**: 
   - If you get stuck on a task, donâ€™t be afraid to ask for help. Sometimes, just talking through the problem can lead to a solution. Pair programming can also be reintroduced as a method to address particularly challenging problems.

2. **Break Down the Problem**: 
   - If a task feels overwhelming or unclear, break it down into smaller tasks. Sometimes, working on smaller pieces can provide clarity for the larger issue.

3. **Online Communities and Platforms**: 
   - Websites like Stack Overflow, GitHub, and Reddit (specifically, subreddits related to programming) are fantastic resources. Chances are someone has faced a similar problem. Just remember to always understand the solutions you find, not just copy them.

4. **Official Documentation**: 
   - Always check the official documentation of the language, library, or framework you're using. They often contain examples, best practices, and detailed explanations.

5. **Use Debugging Tools**: 
   - Familiarize yourself with the debugging tools for your development environment. Properly setting breakpoints, inspecting variables, and walking through code step-by-step can help isolate issues.

6. **Revisit the Basics**: 
   - Sometimes, it's beneficial to review foundational concepts. Websites like W3Schools, MDN Web Docs (for web developers), and tutorial sites like GeeksforGeeks or TutorialsPoint can be useful.

7. **Online Courses and Tutorials**: 
   - Platforms like Coursera, Udemy, and Pluralsight offer courses on various topics. If there's a specific concept or technology that's consistently challenging, consider doing a deep dive with a dedicated course.

8. **Code Examples and Templates**: 
   - GitHub is a rich source of coding examples. Look for reputable repositories related to your problem domain. Additionally, platforms like CodePen for frontend code can be handy.

9. **Take a Break**: 
   - If you're consistently stuck on a problem, sometimes the best solution is to step away for a bit. A fresh perspective after a break can often lead to a solution.
