## Objective
To provide a hands-on understanding of Agile methodologies and User Story management. By the end of this assignment, you should be able to:
- Select relevant user stories for your project.
- Organize and prioritize these stories using Trello.
- Assign user stories to appropriate team members.
- Work collaboratively to complete these user stories.
- Demonstrate the implemented features based on the completed user stories.

## Instructions

### User Story Creation
- As a group, brainstorm potential features and requirements for your software project.
- Convert these features into user stories. Remember, a good user story typically follows the format: 
  > "As a [type of user], I want [an action] so that [a benefit/a value]".
- Note: MOST of this should be done already from "Product personas and stories" assignment.

### Setting Up Trello
- Create a new board for your project on [Trello](https://trello.com/).
- Create the necessary lists to manage your user stories. A basic setup might include lists like `Backlog`, `To Do`, `In Progress`, `Review`, and `Done`.
- Add your user stories to the `Backlog` or `To Do` list on Trello as individual cards.
- Note: This SHOULD be done already.

### Prioritizing and Assigning User Stories
- Prioritize the user stories based on their importance, dependencies, and the overall project scope.
- Discuss and decide as a team how to distribute the work. Assign each Trello card (user story) to one or more team members. Remember to consider each member's strengths, skills, and workload.
- Make sure there is CLEAR acceptance criteria.

### Working on the User Stories
- As you begin working on a user story, move its corresponding Trello card to the `In Progress` list.
- Communicate with your team members regularly. If you face any blockers or need clarifications, address them promptly.
- After review, move the card to the `Done` list.

### Demonstration
- Once all the assigned user stories for this sprint/assignment are in the `Done` list, prepare a demonstration.
- Your demo should showcase the implemented features and how they relate to the respective user stories.
- All team members should participate in the demonstration, explaining their contributions and the importance of their completed user stories to the overall project.

## Submission
- Provide a link to your Trello board so that progress can be monitored.
- Create a short recording demonstrating your work (5-10 mins). Post the video to your teams channel

## Evaluation
Your group will be evaluated on:
- The quality and relevance of your user stories.
- Effective use of Trello to manage and track progress.
- Collaboration and communication among team members.
- The completion of the user stories assigned for this session.
- The quality and clarity of your demonstration.

## Tips and Considerations
- Ensure all team members are familiar with the Agile methodology and Trello's features for maximum efficiency.
- Regularly revisit and revise user stories if necessary. As development progresses, requirements might change.
- Use labels, checklists, and comments within Trello to provide additional information, track subtasks, or clarify any doubts.
- Schedule regular team meetings to discuss progress, address concerns, and ensure everyone is aligned with the project goals.
